# Bias Variance Trade Off

This program is to simulate the bias variance trade off plot for a population generate using using the equation

`$$\2x^4-3x^3+7x^2-23x+8+N(0,3)$$`

We can generate polynomial models till the nth degree with this program, also code for the lagrange's polynomial model is included too. This program outputs the bias and variance of the n polynomial models and the lagrange's model. The polynomial model fit will be plotted and also the bias-variance graph will also be plotted.

The ouptut of this program will be:
