# Normal Curve Plotting

A gaussian is plotted for the given normal function, two graphs are plotted where one has 3 different plots with the same mean and different standard
deviations and the other one also has 3 different plots with same standard deviations and different means, and we can visually notice the difference
between the normal curves.

The normal curve equation is:

$$ \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi }} e^{ -\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}} $$

The graphs plotted are:
